This program solves sudoku puzzles.
The puzzles to use can be found and downloaded at http://lipas.uwasa.fi/~timan/sudoku/.
When running the program, you must pass two arguments. The first argument is the file path to the sudoku puzzle to be solved,
and the second argument will be the highest number of variables to consider simultaneously for reducing domain sizes by inference.
The program calls the value of the second argument "magnitude".
